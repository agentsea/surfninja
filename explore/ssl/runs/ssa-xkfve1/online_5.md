**User:** "I've provided you with two images of a desktop GUI, first is an image of the state of the GUI before the mouse was clicked. 
The second image is an image of the state of the GUI after the mouse was clicked. Please describe the current state of the screen in detail, paying attention to any changes in the screen that may have occured from the click. 
This will be used to train a world model, so please return the response in a form that only describes the changes in the screen e.g. 'A login screen where the user can input their credentials or use social login' 
or if there is no difference in the images then simple return 'no change'."
