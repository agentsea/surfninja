**User:** "I've provided you with two images of a desktop GUI, first is an image of the state of the GUI before the mouse was clicked. 
The second image is an image of the state of the GUI after the mouse was clicked. Please describe the current state of the screen in detail, paying attention to any changes in the screen that may have occured from the click. 
This will be used to train a world model, so please return the response in a form that only describes the changes in the screen e.g. 'A login screen where the user can input their credentials or use social login' 
or if there is no difference in the images then simple return 'no change'."

**User:** "<ImageHere> I've provided you with an image of a desktop UI. We are trying to click the screen in the right location which will cause the following environment change: 'A share dialog titled "Share this experience" with options like "Copy Link," "Messages," "Messenger," "Email," "WhatsApp," "Facebook," and "Twitter" has appeared. The dialog shares the event "Go VIP with Kevin Hart."'.
The current mouse coordinates are [350, 100]. Please return the new coordinates in the form [x, y]. For example if we need to open the user settings and the user button is located at (450, 740) we would return [450, 740].
